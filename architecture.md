## Frontend
The frontend drives the system flow.
It is mainly javascript. 
This javascript is not written by hand. 
It is generated by compiling ClojureScript. 
This allows us to use Javascript, the good parts without worrying about the bad parts.

## Backend
The backend handles incoming event prompts.
It receives and processes all events via a queue.
This piece is written in golang for easy binary compilation to target OSes.
